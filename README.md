# FOL_Chess
A chess puzzle game designed to help teach first-order logic. Made for my MSc computer science dissertation.
The game can be played or downloaded at: https://ithun.itch.io/logic-chess, where you can also find other video games I have made.

At the moment the files in this repository are just the scripts used in the game which are applied to Unity GameObjects in practice.
